# Shadcn UI Usage Guide
This project will exclusively use Shadcn UI components for all styling purposes. No other UI libraries or custom styling elements should be introduced. If a required component is not available in Shadcn UI, please refer to the official Shadcn UI documentation to download and integrate it.
