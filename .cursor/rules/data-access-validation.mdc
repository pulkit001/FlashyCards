# Data Access and Validation Guidelines

- **Data Retrieval:** All data retrieval in this project must be performed using Server Components.

- **Data Modification (CUD Operations):** Any Create, Update, or Delete operations on our database must always be handled by Server Actions.

- **Data Validation:** Data validation must be done using [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas, and the corresponding TypeScript types should be derived from these schemas. Avoid using `FormData` as a type for validation.
